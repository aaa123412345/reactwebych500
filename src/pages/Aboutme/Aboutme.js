                    Let me do some self-introduction first. My name is Yim Chi Ho.
                    I am a student at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. My major 
                    is Multimedia and Internet Technology. I believe that my academic 
                    result is quite good. (wGPA:3.41) 
                    <br/><br/>
                    However, I still think that I need to learn more for my future career 
                    so I always do self-study for learning the latest technic. React is not 
                    taught at University but I can learn it easily because
                    React.js has an amazing society. There are lots of examples 
                    and tutorials for me to learn quickly.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I think that I am a cautious and organized person so I will keep my code clean and easy to maintain.
                    I am willing to learn anything new. Although learning costs lot of time, 
                    my productivity will be increased after learning new technic. It is a fair trade. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    I think that the Computer is a wonderful invention. I like using my programming skill for solving problems.
                    For example, I can use python and its library to build software for finding the answer to the university's exercise. 
                    It is not easy since most of the exercise will include a big problem and I need to divide it into many parts. Also, 
                    I need to know what is the requirement. This experience provides me more chances for using programming in my daily life.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I enjoy playing a Computer games. My favorite game is Minecraft since it provides me a chance for creating anything.
                    Moreover, you can use red stone in this game to simulate the logic. You can build a counter, calculator, or even computer 
                    in this JAVA game. It let me want to build my game too so I learn how to make my game by using different software such as 
                    c++, C# window form, and Unity.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The assets are important in a game. Luckily, the university provides some courses to help me to build a sense of art.
                    I also learn how to use Blender at Unversity. The image in the upper part of my website is my works. I think it looks quite good
                    since it is my first time rendering my model and texture.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I want to find a intern to learn that how to work in real productive environemt. I think this type of experenice
                    can help me to find my target easily. It also helps me to improve myself. I want to find a intern which is about 
                    web development (either backend or frontend), game development or machine learning. All of these is my first target.
